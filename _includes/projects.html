  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>In my freetime, I want to learn how to perform fullstack development. For
    now, I will be mainly working front-end devlopment while utilizing
    multiple frameworks such as React, Bootstrap, or any other that I may be
    interested in. I intend to learn more about HTML & CSS in order to perfect
    the style and organization of it. At the same time, I want to teach myself
    how to use Javascript and incorporate it into my website. Jekyll seems to be
    limited in what I want to use it for, as I know it is mainly a blog framework.
    Eventually, I will transition to another framework.</p>

  <h2>Technologies</h2>

      <li>Java</li>
      <li>JUnit</li>
      <li>Excel</li>

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>While still in the works, this would inhibit a simulation of a running
      restaurant that has people, workers, food, laws, prices, and everything
      that is involved within the restaurant scene. It will mainly be coded in
      Java. However, the data will be crunched within Excel and visualized using
      Python to do some other number crunching too. It is still a WIP, so more is
      to come in the near future.</p>
