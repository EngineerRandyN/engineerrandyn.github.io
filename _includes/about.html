  <p> My name is Randy Nguyen. I am an undergraduate Computer Science student
  in my senior year. I will be pursuing a Master's after my Bachelor's.
  I plan to use my freetime to create my website over my lifetime. As well as
  working on other big projects that are yet to come. I mainly work in Java,
  but I want to be able to work as a full-stack developer during my freetime.
  <br><br>Below are technologies I know about at various degrees of knowledge.
  I plan to work more in HTML & CSS and Javascript within multiple frameworks
  such as Jekyll. Currently, I am making myself learn jquery and Jekyll while
  trying to get the grasp of web development within a full-stack environment.
  I consider myself to be a beginner in web development, so this website will 
  constantly change as I continue to learn. My goal is to create a theme that
  would showcase my website a lot better, but I currently am learning how
  to structure a website before anything else.
  <br><br>I am available to be contacted via randynguyen09@hotmail.com for any
  job offers or requests of my resume.</p>
